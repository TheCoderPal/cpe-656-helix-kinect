Audio Library Prototype
September 19, 2011


Purpose:  This application was written to test speech recognition for a GIS application by providing a generic API.  The GIS application used is the ArcGIS WPF SDK.  The audio capture device used is the Microsoft Kinect.


Application Pre-requisites:

1.) Speech Platform Runtime (v10.2) x86. Even on x64 platforms, the x86 must be used because the Microsoft Research Kinect SDK Beta runtime is x86.
